## Bank Routing Number Search 

A simple way to figure out which routing numbers belong to which banks.  The plan is also to put my own check volumes into the json data at some point.

So Why?

Using SQL, I can easily query the volume for a particular Routing Number (RT).  But I can't as easily define who that RT belongs to.  This simple program accomplishes it for me.
